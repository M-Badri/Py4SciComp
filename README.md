# Py4SciComp
Python for Scientific Computing (FEniCS, PyTorch, VTK) 


Py4SciComp is an educational effort that attempts to make three useful open-source Python-based resources in scinetific computing accessable with tutorials, sample codes/data, and short theoretical lectures:

**FEniCS**: FEniCS is an open-source finite-element method (FEM) solver for solving PDEs. Users are expected to be familiar with weak form formulation of PDEs and FEniCS provides a flexible environment for coding the weak forms and FEM problem. BEhind the curtains FEniCS converts the Python code to a HPC-supported C++ code and runs it. \
**PyTorch**: PyTorch is a very popular framework for implementing deep learning codes. \
**VTK**: Visualization Toolkit (VTK) libraries provide various useful tools for pre- and post- processing of mesh-based and discrete data efficiently. Popular visualization software like ParaView are built based on VTK.\
**A Unified Python cyberinfrastructure**: It is the hope that these resources motivate development of unified Python cuberinfrastructure that integrate these resources for scientific computing. 


In this Github directory, we provide a series of tutorials. Each tutorial is accompanied by a short Youtube video, sample codes, and data.  Available resources (to be expanded in the future):
